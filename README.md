So I recently created  assistant and gave it my own thoughts and voice in order to simulate the feeling of it being a digital duplicate of me. Inorder to make this assistant I had to learn to code in python as I knew only basics of python before the project. I had to watch a lot of tutorials on youtube and the ones which helped me the most are linked below this paragraph, so after watching the tutorials I started to conceptualize the flowchart of my program. You can see the the flow chart in the image given below.


TUTORIALS THAT HELPED ME:-

1. Create your own virtual assistant by Programming Hero.
2. Create your own AI VOICE ASSISTANT!! by Veraxity.
3. Create a ChatGPT Voice Assistant in 8 Minutes by Ai Austin.
