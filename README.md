So I recently created an assistant and gave it my own thoughts and voice in order to simulate the feeling of it being a digital duplicate of me. Inorder to make this assistant I had to learn to code in python as I knew only basics of python before the project. I had to watch a lot of tutorials on youtube and the ones which helped me the most are linked below this paragraph.

TUTORIALS THAT HELPED ME :-
1. Create your own virtual assistant by Programming Hero.
2. Create your own AI VOICE ASSISTANT!! by Veraxity.
3. Create a ChatGPT Voice Assistant in 8 Minutes by Ai Austin.

So once I started programming the Assistant, I had to face a huge number of errors and I had no idea how to fix those errors but I kept watching youtube tutorials to fix those errors and after a lot of coding I came up with my own digital assistant which was basically me. See the output of my project is not an AI as it uses no machine learning models instead it is a voice assistant. The assistant can do basic tasks like playing songs, searching google, ringing and locating my phone, opening applications, expressing my thoughts and send whatsapp messages. For more elaboration watch the full video on my channel. You can have a look at the code, its given and explained below.

The code has been generalized inorder to make it understandable.

MODULES REQUIRED :-
1. openai
2. Pywhatkit
3. Playsound
4. Webbrowser
5. Pyautogui
6. Speech recognition
7. pyttsx3

Above mentioned modules are required for the program.
